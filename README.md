# 100 days of ML

**My week 1/15(100 day of ML)**

During this week I learned so many thing about linear Algebra.
Some of the highlights are: 
1. Vector (Addition, subtraction,multiplication by a Scalar) Representation on a Graph.
2. Unit Vectors
3. 2&3D real coordinate Space
4. Spans
5. Linear Dependence
6. Subspace
7. Cool things about Matrix
I referred Khan Academy(this was my first time) and I love how they teach. 
They made it some simple with visual graphical representation.

**Week - 2/15 ( 100 days of ML )**

This whole week is kind of different.
Instead of learning formulaes, I learned how they come in first place.
Some of the highlights are:
1. How area of circle = Ï€r^2
2. Area under graph
3. What is derivative ( how d(x^n)/dt = nx^n-1 )
4. Chain Rule
5. Fundamental theorem of calcus
6. Taylor series

I referred 3Blue1Brown - Essence of Calcus and some blogs on medium, on particular topics.

2. Sample Space
3. Event
4. Probability Distribution
5. Disjoint and Non disjoint events
6. Marginal, joint and conditional probability
7. Bayes Theorem.( Little bit of hands on with Python - Spam Filtering data visualization).
This week I have gone through some books and blogs.

        This data set contains the following features:

        * 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
        * 'Age': cutomer age in years
        * 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
