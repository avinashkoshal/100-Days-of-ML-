# 100 days of ML

**My week 1/15(100 day of ML)**

During this week I learned so many thing about linear Algebra.
Some of the highlights are: 
1. Vector (Addition, subtraction,multiplication by a Scalar) Representation on a Graph.
2. Unit Vectors
3. 2&3D real coordinate Space
4. Spans
5. Linear Dependence
6. Subspace
7. Cool things about Matrix
I referred Khan Academy(this was my first time) and I love how they teach. 
They made it some simple with visual graphical representation.

**Week - 2/15 ( 100 days of ML )**

This whole week is kind of different.
Instead of learning formulaes, I learned how they come in first place.
Some of the highlights are:
1. How area of circle = πr^2
2. Area under graph
3. What is derivative ( how d(x^n)/dt = nx^n-1 )
4. Chain Rule
5. Fundamental theorem of calcus
6. Taylor series

I referred 3Blue1Brown - Essence of Calcus and some blogs on medium, on particular topics.

**Week - 3/15  ( 100 days of ML )**

During this week Learned about Probability.
Some of the highlights are:
1. Random Variables
2. Sample Space
3. Event
4. Probability Distribution
5. Disjoint and Non disjoint events
6. Marginal, joint and conditional probability
7. Bayes Theorem.( Little bit of hands on with Python - Spam Filtering data visualization).
This week I have gone through some books and blogs.

**Week - 4/15 ( 100 days of ML )**

This week is all about Statistics.
Some highlights are:
1. Inferential Statistics
2. Central Limit Theorem
3. Hypothesis Testing 
        1. Null Hypothesis
        2. Alternate Hypothesis
4. Errors in Hypothesis Testing
5. ANOVA( Analysis of Variance)
6. Regression
7. R-Square
8. Correlation coefficient
Resources used : Analytics Vidhya, medium blogs and YouTube.

**Week - 5 / 15 (100 days of ML)**

I have decided to dedicate this month for Python
In the past few days I have brushed my existing knowledge of Python and now I am diving deep into Particular libraries.
So far I have explored.
1. Python Basics
2. Python for Data Analysis
   ```
        1. Numpy
        2. Panda's
    ```
3. Python for Data Visualization
     ```
        1. Matplotlib
        2. Seaborn
      ```
I am following a Course on Udemy named "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" By  Jose Portilla

**Week - 6 / 15 (100 days of ML)**

I have decided to dedicate this month for Python
In contiunation to previous week, I have explored:

1. Python for Data Visualization
   ```
      1. Cufflinks
      2. Plotly
      3. Geographical Plotting.
    ```
2. Did some Data Analysis and Visualization on Datasets available on Kaggle.
3. I am maintaing a repo on Github do check this out https://github.com/aaavinash85/100-Days-of-ML-

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week - 7 / 15 (100 days of ML)**
During this week.

1. I have analyzed 911 call data from Kaggle
   - Pandas
   - Seaborn

2. Finance Data Project
    - exploratory data analysis of stock prices
    - practice your visualization and pandas skills
- Jupyter notebooks are available on my Github

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week - 8 / 15 (100 days of ML)**

I started with ML

1. Introduction to ML
2. Linear Regression
    - Data preparation
    - Data Visualization
    - Defining a Model
    - Model Training
    - Model Evaluation
    - Predciotn on trained Model

----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week - 9 / 15 (100 days of ML)**

1. Cross Validation and Bias Variance Trade off
2. Logistic Regression
    - Titanic Dataset
      ```
        - Exploratory Data Analysis
        - Cufflinks for plots
        - Converting Categorical Features
      ```  
    - Worked on fake advertising data set
     ```
      Created a model that will predict whether or not people will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

        This data set contains the following features:

        * 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
        * 'Age': cutomer age in years
        * 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
        * 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
        * 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
        * 'City': City of consumer
        * 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
        * 'Country': Country of consumer
        * 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
        * 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
     ```
- Jupyter notebooks are available on my Github
